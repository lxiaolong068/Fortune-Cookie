# Task Plan: FortuneCookie Messages doc update
<!-- 
  WHAT: This is your roadmap for the entire task. Think of it as your "working memory on disk."
  WHY: After 50+ tool calls, your original goals can get forgotten. This file keeps them fresh.
  WHEN: Create this FIRST, before starting any work. Update after each phase completes.
-->

## Goal
<!-- 
  WHAT: One clear sentence describing what you're trying to achieve.
  WHY: This is your north star. Re-reading this keeps you focused on the end state.
  EXAMPLE: "Create a Python CLI todo app with add, list, and delete functionality."
-->
Update docs/FortuneCookie-Messages.md with agreed edits/merges and ship a clean, consistent optimization doc.

## Current Phase
<!-- 
  WHAT: Which phase you're currently working on (e.g., "Phase 1", "Phase 3").
  WHY: Quick reference for where you are in the task. Update this as you progress.
-->
Phase 4

## Phases
<!-- 
  WHAT: Break your task into 3-7 logical phases. Each phase should be completable.
  WHY: Breaking work into phases prevents overwhelm and makes progress visible.
  WHEN: Update status after completing each phase: pending → in_progress → complete
-->

### Phase 1: Requirements & Discovery
<!-- 
  WHAT: Understand what needs to be done and gather initial information.
  WHY: Starting without understanding leads to wasted effort. This phase prevents that.
-->
- [x] Understand user intent (planning workflow requested; target file noted)
- [x] Identify constraints and requirements (planning-with-files, telegraph style)
- [x] Document findings in findings.md
- **Status:** complete
<!-- 
  STATUS VALUES:
  - pending: Not started yet
  - in_progress: Currently working on this
  - complete: Finished this phase
-->

### Phase 2: Planning & Structure
<!-- 
  WHAT: Decide how you'll approach the problem and what structure you'll use.
  WHY: Good planning prevents rework. Document decisions so you remember why you chose them.
-->
- [x] Define doc update approach (apply P0 doc + code alignment)
- [x] Identify source files to merge (only docs/FortuneCookie-Messages.md present)
- [x] Document decisions with rationale
- **Status:** complete

### Phase 3: Implementation
<!-- 
  WHAT: Actually build/create/write the solution.
  WHY: This is where the work happens. Break into smaller sub-tasks if needed.
-->
- [x] Apply edits to docs/FortuneCookie-Messages.md
- [x] Resolve duplicates/overlaps with other docs (none present)
- [x] Ensure headings/structure consistent
- [x] Add category totals + ISO updated dates on message sections
- [x] Pass tags into Generate Similar + generator custom prompt
- [x] Enrich category JSON-LD fields and add copy success toast feedback
- **Status:** complete

### Phase 4: Testing & Verification
<!-- 
  WHAT: Verify everything works and meets requirements.
  WHY: Catching issues early saves time. Document test results in progress.md.
-->
- [ ] Verify doc matches requested scope and sources
- [ ] Verify category counts/ISO dates and JSON-LD output
- [ ] Document checks in progress.md
- [ ] Fix any issues found
- **Status:** in_progress

### Phase 5: Delivery
<!-- 
  WHAT: Final review and handoff to user.
  WHY: Ensures nothing is forgotten and deliverables are complete.
-->
- [ ] Review updated doc for clarity/consistency
- [ ] Ensure deliverables complete
- [ ] Deliver to user
- **Status:** pending

## Key Questions
<!-- 
  WHAT: Important questions you need to answer during the task.
  WHY: These guide your research and decision-making. Answer them as you go.
  EXAMPLE: 
    1. Should tasks persist between sessions? (Yes - need file storage)
    2. What format for storing tasks? (JSON file)
-->
1. What exact edits/outputs are required for docs/FortuneCookie-Messages.md?
2. Which other docs should be merged or referenced?
3. Language preference (CN only vs bilingual)?

## Decisions Made
<!-- 
  WHAT: Technical and design decisions you've made, with the reasoning behind them.
  WHY: You'll forget why you made choices. This table helps you remember and justify decisions.
  WHEN: Update whenever you make a significant choice (technology, approach, structure).
  EXAMPLE:
    | Use JSON for storage | Simple, human-readable, built-in Python support |
-->
| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Implement P0 UI parity + doc status update | Align messages page with spec while keeping scope tight |
| Use category param for generator links | Preserve theme mapping for non-standard categories |

## Errors Encountered
<!-- 
  WHAT: Every error you encounter, what attempt number it was, and how you resolved it.
  WHY: Logging errors prevents repeating the same mistakes. This is critical for learning.
  WHEN: Add immediately when an error occurs, even if you fix it quickly.
  EXAMPLE:
    | FileNotFoundError | 1 | Check if file exists, create empty list if not |
    | JSONDecodeError | 2 | Handle empty file case explicitly |
-->
| Error | Attempt | Resolution |
|-------|---------|------------|
| File not found: docs/FortuneCookie Messages 专项优化改进建议.md | 1 | Confirm correct filename/path |

## Notes
<!-- 
  REMINDERS:
  - Update phase status as you progress: pending → in_progress → complete
  - Re-read this plan before major decisions (attention manipulation)
  - Log ALL errors - they help avoid repetition
  - Never repeat a failed action - mutate your approach instead
