**Date:** 2025-12-12
**Status:** Completed
**Focus:** SEO, Trending Topics (2025), English Culture, Personal Development

## 1. Research Overview (研究概览)

Based on the analysis of existing content in `content/blog/` and web search trends for late 2024/2025, several high-potential gaps were identified. Existing content heavily focuses on the *history*, *psychology of luck*, and *AI technology* behind fortune cookies.

**Key Missing Themes & Opportunities:**
*   **English Learning (Micro-learning):** Learning idioms and cultural phrases through short, digestible fortune cookie quotes is a strong "Edutainment" niche.
*   **Personal Development (Micro-habits):** The 2025 wellness trend focuses on "micro-habits" and "daily affirmations" rather than grand overhauls. Fortune cookies fit perfectly as a daily micro-habit.
*   **Digital Social Connection:** There is a growing trend of "digital surprise" and gamified interactions in messaging (e.g., sending a digital cookie to a crush or colleague).
*   **Workplace Morale:** Virtual ice-breakers for remote teams are a consistent evergreen search topic.
