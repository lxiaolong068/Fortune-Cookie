# The Fascinating History of Fortune Cookies

Fortune cookies are one of the most recognizable symbols of Chinese-American cuisine, yet their true origins might surprise you. These crispy, folded treats containing paper fortunes have a rich and unexpected history that spans continents and cultures.

## Japanese Origins

Contrary to popular belief, fortune cookies did not originate in China. Historical evidence suggests they were actually inspired by Japanese **tsujiura senbei** (辻占煎餅), a type of cracker containing paper fortunes that has been made in Kyoto since at least the 19th century.

Japanese immigrants brought this tradition to America in the late 1800s and early 1900s. The modern fortune cookie as we know it was likely invented in California, though several families claim credit for its creation.

## The American Innovation

Three main contenders claim to have invented the fortune cookie:

1. **Makoto Hagiwara** - A Japanese immigrant who managed the Japanese Tea Garden in San Francisco, allegedly served fortune cookies as early as 1914.

2. **David Jung** - Founder of the Hong Kong Noodle Company in Los Angeles, claimed to have invented them in 1918 to uplift the poor.

3. **Seiichi Kito** - Owner of Fugetsu-do confectionery in Los Angeles, also claimed to have introduced fortune cookies around the same time.

In 1983, the San Francisco Court of Historical Review ruled in favor of San Francisco as the birthplace of the fortune cookie - though the debate continues to this day!

## From Japanese to Chinese

During World War II, Japanese Americans were forced into internment camps. Chinese Americans took over the production of fortune cookies, and the treats became associated with Chinese restaurants rather than Japanese ones.

By the 1960s and 1970s, automated fortune cookie machines made production faster and cheaper, cementing the cookie's place as a staple of Chinese-American dining.

## Fortune Cookie Fun Facts

- **3 billion fortune cookies** are made each year
- The largest producer, Wonton Food Inc., makes over 4 million cookies daily
- Fortune cookies are virtually unknown in China - they're an American invention!
- The "lucky numbers" on fortune cookies have actually won lottery prizes for some people

## The Fortune Inside

The messages inside fortune cookies have evolved over time:

- **Traditional fortunes** offer vague, optimistic predictions
- **Confucius-style sayings** provide philosophical wisdom
- **Modern variations** include jokes, fun facts, and even advertisements

Today, fortune cookies remain a beloved tradition, sparking smiles and conversation at the end of countless meals.
