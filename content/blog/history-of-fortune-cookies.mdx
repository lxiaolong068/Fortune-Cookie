# The Fascinating History of Fortune Cookies

Fortune cookies are one of the most recognizable symbols of Chinese-American cuisine, yet their true origins might surprise you. These crispy, folded treats containing paper fortunes have a rich and unexpected history that spans continents and cultures.

## Japanese Origins

Contrary to popular belief, fortune cookies did not originate in China. Historical evidence suggests they were actually inspired by Japanese **tsujiura senbei** (辻占煎餅), a type of cracker containing paper fortunes that has been made in Kyoto since at least the 19th century.

Unlike the modern vanilla-flavored cookie, the original *tsujiura senbei* were larger, darker, and made with sesame and miso. The fortune was also tucked into the fold of the cookie rather than placed inside the hollow center. Japanese immigrants brought this tradition to America in the late 1800s and early 1900s.

## The American Innovation

Three main contenders claim to have invented the fortune cookie:

1. **Makoto Hagiwara** - A Japanese immigrant who managed the Japanese Tea Garden in San Francisco, allegedly served fortune cookies as early as 1914.

2. **David Jung** - Founder of the Hong Kong Noodle Company in Los Angeles, claimed to have invented them in 1918 to uplift the poor.

3. **Seiichi Kito** - Owner of Fugetsu-do confectionery in Los Angeles, also claimed to have introduced fortune cookies around the same time.

In 1983, the San Francisco Court of Historical Review ruled in favor of San Francisco as the birthplace of the fortune cookie - though the debate continues to this day!

### The Trial of the Century
The rivalry between San Francisco (Hagiwara) and Los Angeles (Jung) became so heated that it went to court—sort of. In 1983, San Francisco's pseudo-legal "Court of Historical Review" held a mock trial to settle the matter. Presided over by a federal judge, the court heard arguments and evidence from both sides. Ultimately, the judge ruled in favor of Makoto Hagiwara and San Francisco, citing the Japanese Tea Garden's long history. While not legally binding, it remains a favorite piece of local lore.

## From Japanese to Chinese

During World War II, Japanese Americans were forced into internment camps. Chinese Americans took over the production of fortune cookies, and the treats became associated with Chinese restaurants rather than Japanese ones.

By the 1960s and 1970s, the industry faced a new challenge: demand was outstripping the capacity of hand-folding.

## The Automation Revolution
For decades, fortune cookies were folded by hand—a labor-intensive process that limited production. This changed in the late 1960s when **Edward Louie**, owner of the Lotus Fortune Cookie Company in San Francisco, invented the first automatic fortune cookie machine.

Louie's machine could insert the fortune and fold the cookie while the dough was still hot and pliable. This innovation caused prices to drop and production to skyrocket, allowing fortune cookies to become the ubiquitous complimentary treat we know today. Modern factories, like those of Wonton Food Inc., now churn out over 4 million cookies a day!

Today, fortune cookies remain a beloved tradition, sparking smiles and conversation at the end of countless meals.
