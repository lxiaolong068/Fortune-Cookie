## Why We Need New Fortunes

The world has changed. We have [AI writing our future](/blog/ai-fortune-telling-trends-2025), algorithms predicting our purchases, and social media curating our reality. Traditional fortune cookies ("You will travel to many places") feel disconnected from our digital, hyper-ironic lives.

Humor allows us to process the absurdity of modern existence. Whether it's the specific pain of corporate jargon or the madness of online dating, laughing at it makes it manageable.
